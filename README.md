# Face Recognition System

A real-time **Face Recognition System** built using **Python** and **OpenCV** that detects and identifies faces from live camera feed. This project demonstrates computer vision, image processing, and machine learning fundamentals.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar cascades and OpenCV
- Face recognition from a database of images
- Highlights recognized faces with names on the camera feed
- Easy to extend and integrate with other systems

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How It Works
1. The system captures video from a webcam.
2. Detects faces using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade classifier.
3. Recognizes faces using a trained dataset and labels them in real-time.
4. Displays output with detected faces and their names.

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzlanFaisalRaj/Face-Recognition-System.git
